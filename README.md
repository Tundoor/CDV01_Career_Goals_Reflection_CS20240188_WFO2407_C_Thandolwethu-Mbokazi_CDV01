      - The healthcare industry is an industry where reliabilty is guaranteed as they work with patients who constently rely on the healthcare professionals. Therefore this aligns with one of my own values. Healthcare also aligns with my  own personal interests a I would get to see how technology is used in a sector I didn't expect to use technologies such as web design and user-interfaces. 
   
      - The business industry has a number of opportunities to grow withinn the industry. Not just in relation to coding but in other aspects aswell. Thiss aligns with my interest in learning. I feel that in the business industry I would be able to gain a lot of valuable information. It also aligns with the value of good communication in a business as in the business industry you need to be able to communicate well in order for you to become successful.

    *Identify any gaps or areas for further exploration.
